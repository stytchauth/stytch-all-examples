# Stytch Example Apps

Stytch provides SDKs for a number of different languages, frameworks, and implementation approaches. This monorepo contains simple example apps that demonstrate our various frontend and backend SDKs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) (Node Version Manager)

### Stytch Dashboard Setup

Before running any example apps, you'll need to configure your Stytch project:

1. **Enable the Frontend SDK**: Go to your [Stytch Dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard) â†’ **Frontend SDK** page â†’ enable the **Frontend SDK**

2. **Get your credentials**: On the **Project Overview** page, you'll find:
   - **Project ID** - Used by backend applications
   - **Public Token** - Used by frontend applications
   - **Secret** - Used by backend applications for server-side operations

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The Project Overview page shows all the credentials you need for each app type. Frontend apps typically need the Public Token, while backend apps need the Project ID and Secret.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:stytchauth/stytch-all-examples.git
   cd stytch-all-examples
   ```

2. **Switch to the correct Node.js version:**

   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Implementation Types

Before exploring the repository, it's helpful to understand the different types of implementations:

- **Headless**: You build your own UI from scratch using Stytch Headless SDK methods - full control over styling and user experience
- **Prebuilt**: Uses Stytch's pre-built UI components with minimal setup - faster to implement but less customization
- **Backend**: Server-side authentication handling with custom UI - demonstrates API integration patterns

## Repository Structure & Getting Started

This monorepo contains example applications organized by framework, implementation type, and Stytch data model (B2B vs Consumer). To run a specific example app:

1. **Navigate to the specific package you want to build**

2. **Follow the instructions in that package's README** for setup and running instructions specific to that implementation.
